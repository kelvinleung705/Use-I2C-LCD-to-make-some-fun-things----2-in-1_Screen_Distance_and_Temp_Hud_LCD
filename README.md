# Use-I2C-LCD-to-make-some-fun-things----2-in-1_Screen_Distance_and_Temp_Hud_LCD
Usually I face to my 24 inch monitor a few hours a day for schoolwork/ programming/ entainment. Since I always put my head too close to the monitor, I felt my eyes was really dry after the useing of my computer everytime. So I decided to make a alert system that can told me that I put my head too close to the monitor. Umm the DHT11 temperature amd Humidity is only a add-on of this system.

This system really prevent me from putting my head too close to teh monitor. This project meets my origional reason of learning programming-----improve human life without new technologies.
